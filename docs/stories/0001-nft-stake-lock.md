## Contract

### Errors

The contract throws the following errors:

```solidity
// Custom error types
error InvalidFees(); // thrown when the fees are invalid (less than 0)
error InvalidRewardRate(); // thrown when the reward rate is invalid (less than 0)
error MissingNftAddress(); // thrown when the NFT contract address is not provided
error NFTAddressCannotBeZero(); // thrown when the NFT contract address is the zero address
error InvalidTokenId(); // thrown when the token ID does not exist
error NotYourNFTToken(); // thrown when the token does not belong to the user attempting an action
error InsufficientFundsSent(); // thrown when insufficient funds are sent for fees
error ClaimNotReady(); // thrown when (actual height - (stop height + period)) blocks is less than 0
error Unauthorized(); // thrown when has no enough access permissions
error InvalidPeriod(); // thrown when the staking period is not valid enumerate option
error AlreadyStaked(); // thrown when attempting to start staking for a token already staked
error NFTNotStaked(); // thrown when attempting to stop staking for a token not staked by the user
```

### Events

```solidity
// Define events
event LockNFTSuccess();
event UnlockNFTSuccess();
event RecoverNFTSuccess();
event ConsumeRewardsSuccess();
```

### Structs

```solidity
// Enum for periods
enum Period {
    ONE_DAY,
    SEVEN_DAYS,
    TWENTY_ONE_DAYS
}

// Struct for TokenData
struct TokenData {
    Period period; // Represents the period measured by height units that the NFT gets lock after unlocked where no Rewards are generated during this Period.
    uint256 start; // Starting height use on rewards calculation. Start when the owner stake and transfer ownership.
    uint256 end; // Ending height use on rewards calculation. Once unstake it, no more rewards will be counted.
}

// Struct for UserData
struct UserData {
    uint256 rewards; // Accumulated reward points, only updated when claim successful.
    mapping(uint256 => TokenData) tokens; // User token mapping data
}
```

### Variables

```solidity
// State Variables
address public nft; // Represents the ERC721 address
uint256 public rewardRate; // Represents how many rewards are produced by each height increase while staked
uint256 public fees; // Fees for startStaking(), stopStaking() and recover()
mapping(address => UserData) public users; // users staking and nft data
mapping(address => bool) public whitelist; // list of smart contracts that can interact with user points
```

### Functions

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Constructor function for the contract
 * @param _nftAddress Address of the NFT contract
 * @param _rewardRate Reward rate for staking
 * @param _feeAmount Fee amount for locking NFTs
 */
constructor(address _nftAddress, uint256 _rewardRate, uint256 _feeAmount) public {
  // - Store the owner.
  // - Check `rewardRate` =< 0
  //   - Throw `InvalidRewardRate`.
  // - Set `rewardRate`.

```

```solidity
/**

 * @param period The period of time to lock the NFT for
 * @return bool Whether the NFT was successfully locked
 */
function lockNFT(uint256 tokenId, uint256 period) public payable {
  // - Check if `tokenId` exist using `ERC721` `balanceOf(sender)` method.
  //   - Throw error `InvalidTokenId`

  //   - Throw error `InsufficientFundsSent`
  // - Check if correct `period` with valid enums periods.
  //   - Throw error `InvalidPeriod`
  // - Set as owner of `tokenId` using `IERC721` interface `safeTransferFrom(from, to, tokenId)`.
  // - Update `user.get(tokenId).start` and `user.get(tokenId).period`.
  // - Return event `LockNFTSuccess`
}
```

## User Scenarios

```gherkin
Feature: NFT Start Staking
  As a user
  I want to be able to lock my NFT for staking
  So that I can earn rewards

  Scenario: Lock NFT for staking
    Given I have an NFT
    And I am the owner of the NFT
    When I lock the NFT for staking with a valid period
    And I pay the required fees
    Then the NFT should be locked for staking
    And I should be able to view my NFT ownership

  Scenario: Lock NFT with invalid period
    Given I have an NFT
    And I am the owner of the NFT
    When I lock the NFT for staking with an invalid period
    Then an InvalidPeriod error should be thrown

  Scenario: Lock NFT without paying fees
    Given I have an NFT
    And I am the owner of the NFT
    When I lock the NFT for staking without paying the required fees
    Then an InsufficientFundsSent error should be thrown

  Scenario: Lock NFT that does not exist
    Given I do not have an NFT
    When I try to lock the NFT for staking
    Then an InvalidTokenId error should be thrown

  Scenario: Lock NFT that is already staked
    Given I have an NFT that is already staked
    When I try to lock the NFT for staking
    Then an AlreadyStaked error should be thrown

  Scenario: Lock NFT that I do not own
    Given I do not own the NFT
    When I try to lock the NFT for staking
    Then a NotYourNFTToken error should be thrown

  Scenario: Lock NFT with negative or zero period
    Given I have an NFT
    And I am the owner of the NFT
    When I lock the NFT for staking with a negative or zero period
    Then an InvalidPeriod error should be thrown

  Scenario: Lock NFT with insufficient fees
    Given I have an NFT
    And I am the owner of the NFT
    When I lock the NFT for staking with insufficient fees
    Then an InsufficientFundsSent error should be thrown
```

## Description

### NFT Stake Lock Functionality Explanation

#### **Step 1: Constructor Initialization**

* **Purpose:** Initializes the NFT Stake Lock contract with essential parameters.
* **Parameters:**
  * `_nftAddress`: The address of the ERC721 NFT contract.
  * `_rewardRate`: The rate at which rewards are generated per block height increase while staking.
  * `_feeAmount`: The fee required for locking NFTs.
* **Validation:**
  * Ensures `_nftAddress` is not empty and not set to zero.
  * Verifies `_rewardRate` is greater than 0.
  * Checks `_feeAmount` is not negative (can be 0).

#### **Step 2: Locking an NFT for Staking**

* **Function:** `lock(uint256 tokenId, uint256 period)`
* **Purpose:** Locks a specified NFT for a defined staking period.
* **Parameters:**
  * `tokenId`: The ID of the NFT to be locked.
  * `period`: The duration for which the NFT is locked (e.g., ONE_DAY, SEVEN_DAYS, TWENTY_ONE_DAYS).
* **Validation & Actions:**

 1. **Token Existence & Ownership**: Verifies the `tokenId` exists and is owned by the user.
 2. **Staking Status**: Checks if the NFT is not already staked.
 3. **Fee Payment**: Ensures the transaction includes sufficient fees (`_feeAmount`).
 4. **Period Validity**: Validates the chosen `period` is one of the accepted durations.
 5. **Lock NFT**: Transfers NFT ownership to the contract and updates the user's staking data (start time and period).

#### **Step 3: Calculating Staking Points**

* **Trigger:** Occurs when a user checks their staking points.
* **Calculation Basis:**
  * **Reward Rate**: The contract's set `_rewardRate`.
  * **Staking Duration**: The time elapsed since the NFT was locked until the current block height.
* **Points Calculation:**
  * `points = (currentBlockHeight - lockBlockHeight) * rewardRate`

#### **Step 4: Error Handling**

* **Scenarios:**
  * Attempting to lock a non-existent, already staked, or non-owned NFT.
  * Insufficient fees or invalid period selection.
  * System errors during points calculation (e.g., invalid period for calculation).
* **Response:** Throws specific, informative errors for each scenario to guide user correction.

#### **Step 5: Deployment and Usage**

* **Pre-deployment:**
  * Full implementation and testing of the feature.
  * Review and approval by the product owner.
  * QA validation.
* **Post-deployment:**
  * The feature is live and accessible to users.
  * Comprehensive documentation (user and technical) is available.
