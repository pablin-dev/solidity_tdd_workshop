## Contract

### Errors

The contract throws the following errors:

```solidity
// Custom error types
error InvalidFees(); // thrown when the fees are invalid (less than 0)
error InvalidRewardRate(); // thrown when the reward rate is invalid (less than 0)
error MissingNftAddress(); // thrown when the NFT contract address is not provided
error NFTAddressCannotBeZero(); // thrown when the NFT contract address is the zero address
error InvalidTokenId(); // thrown when the token ID does not exist
error NotYourNFTToken(); // thrown when the token does not belong to the user attempting an action
error InsufficientFundsSent(); // thrown when insufficient funds are sent for fees
error ClaimNotReady(); // thrown when (block.number - (stop + period)) blocks is less than 0
error Unauthorized(); // thrown when has no enough access permissions
error InvalidPeriod(); // thrown when the staking period is not valid enumerate option
error AlreadyStaked(); // thrown when attempting to start staking for a token already staked
error NFTNotStaked(); // thrown when attempting to stop staking for a token not staked by the user
```

### Events

```solidity
// Define events
event LockNFTSuccess(bool success);
event UnlockNFTSuccess(bool success);
event RecoverNFTSuccess(bool success);
event ConsumeRewardsSuccess(bool success);
```

### Structs

```solidity
// Enum for periods
enum Period {
    ONE_DAY,
    SEVEN_DAYS,
    TWENTY_ONE_DAYS
}

// Struct for TokenData
struct TokenData {
    Period period; // Represents the period measured by height units that the NFT gets lock after unlocked where no Rewards are generated during this Period.
    uint256 start; // Starting height use on rewards calculation. Start when the owner stake and transfer ownership.
    uint256 end; // Ending height use on rewards calculation. Once unstake it, no more rewards will be counted.
}

// Struct for UserData
struct UserData {
    uint256 rewards; // Acumulated reward points, only updated when claim successful.
    mapping(uint256 => TokenData) tokens; // User token mapping data
}
```

### Variables

```solidity
// State Variables
address public nft; // Represents the ERC721 address
uint256 public rewardRate; // Represents how many rewards are produced by each height increase while staked
uint256 public fees; // Fees for startStaking(), stopStaking() and recover()
mapping(address => UserData) public users; // users staking and nft data
mapping(address => bool) public whitelist; // list of smart contracts that can interact with user points
```

### Functions

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Constructor function for the contract
 * @param _nftAddress Address of the NFT contract
 * @param _rewardRate Reward rate for staking
 * @param _feeAmount Fee amount for locking NFTs
 */
constructor(address _nftAddress, uint256 _rewardRate, uint256 _feeAmount) public {
  // - Store the owner.
  // - Check `rewardRate` =< 0
  //   - Throw `InvalidRewardRate`.
  // - Set `rewardRate`.

```

```solidity
// --- Execute: unlockNFT ---
/**

 */
function unlockNFT(uint256 tokenId) public payable {
    // Check if tokenId exists
    // Check tokenId ownership
    // Check if tokenId is staked
    // Check if funds sent are sufficient
    // Update UserData.end with actual height value
    // Return true

  I want to be able to unlock my NFT
  So that I can use it or transfer it to another user

  Scenario: Unlock NFT successfully
    Given I am a user with an NFT that is staked
    And I have sufficient funds to pay the fees
    When I call the unlockNFT function with my NFT's tokenId
    Then the NFT is unlocked
    And the transaction is successful

## Description

### Unlock NFT Functionality Explanation

### Step-by-Step Breakdown of `unlockNFT` Function

```markdown
#### **Step 1: Function Call & Input Validation**
* The user calls the `unlockNFT` function, passing the `tokenId` of the NFT to be unlocked.
* **Validation Check**: The function verifies if the `tokenId` exists in the contract's NFT registry.
 + **Success**: Proceeds to the next step.
 + **Failure**: Throws an **`InvalidTokenId`** error.

#### **Step 2: Ownership Verification**
* The function checks if the caller (user) is the rightful owner of the NFT associated with the provided `tokenId`.
 + **Success**: Proceeds to the next step.
 + **Failure**: Throws a **`NotYourNFTToken`** error.

#### **Step 3: Staking Status Check**
* The contract verifies if the NFT (identified by `tokenId`) is currently in a staked state.
 + **Success**: Proceeds to the next step.
 + **Failure**: Throws an **`NFTNotStaked`** error.

#### **Step 4: Fee Sufficiency Check**
* The function checks if the user has sent sufficient funds to cover the fees associated with unlocking the NFT.
 + **Success**: Proceeds to the next step.
 + **Failure**: Throws an **`InsufficientFundsSent`** error.

#### **Step 5: Update NFT Status & Calculate Rewards (If Applicable)**
* Updates the NFT's status to "unlocked" in the contract's registry.
* **Note**: The provided code snippet does not explicitly mention reward calculation upon unlocking. However, typically, this step might also involve calculating and possibly distributing rewards based on the staking duration and reward rate, if such a mechanism is implemented in the full contract.

#### **Step 6: Emit Success Event & Return**
* Emits an **`UnlockNFTSuccess`** event to notify listeners of the successful unlocking.
* Returns a success indicator to the caller, confirming the NFT has been unlocked.
```

### Additional Considerations & Potential Next Steps

* **Error Handling for Staking Period**: The provided scenarios and code do not explicitly cover the case where the staking period is not valid at the time of unlocking. Ensure this scenario is handled appropriately in the full implementation.
* **Security Audits & Testing**: Perform thorough security audits and testing to ensure the `unlockNFT` function, along with the entire contract, is secure and functions as expected under various conditions.
* **Documentation & User Guidance**: Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation for developers and end-users, outlining the process, requirements, and any specific considerations for unlocking NFTs within the platform.
